# Basecamp

[![Image of Basecamp][producti]][product]

Basecamp is the heartbeat of Hines Digital---our primary project management tool, chat app, and notification center. We create individual basecamps (intentionally lowercased) for each project we’re working on, and for internal and ad hoc needs, as well. Think Slack channels, but more robust.

Individual basecamps are more than just chat rooms — they give us a customizable combination of [six tools][basecamp-tools] to help us tackle the work in front of us. And that customizability is key: we use individual basecamps for a variety of internal and client projects, and each looks a little bit different.

## Client basecamps

For each client project, there ought to be a corresponding basecamp. For this purpose, we’ll define multiple roles under a single contract as a single “project” _(i.e., if we’re hired to build a website and run full-service digital strategy, that’s one project)_. If we’re re-hired in a subsequent election cycle, for example, or in another role during the same cycle (with a new contract), that’d be a new project.

This basecamp should be named {{ year contract ends }}-{{ client nation slug }}-{{ project descriptor }} _(ex: 2016-justinready-fullservice)_.

### Possible Project Descriptors

There are essentially three “project categories” we can use in naming: “hdexpress”, “webdesign”, and “fullservice”. These correlate with the three categories of services we offer our clients:

- *hdexpress*: For projects where we’ve been hired for our [HD Express][hdexpress] service.
- *webdesign*: For projects where we’ve been hired just to build and support custom website design.
- *fullservice*: For projects where we’ve been hired to handle a client’s digital strategy, top to bottom.

### Docs & Files

Within each client basecamp’s “Docs & Files” section, docs and files should be sorted into these folders:

- *Copywriting.* Email drafts, website copy, etc., separated into subfolders accordingly. And within each sub-category _(ex: email drafts)_ there should be `draft` and `approved` folders. Once copy has been approved, move it to the `approved` folder.
- *Design.* Mockups, design drafts, etc. _Not code._
- *From Client.* This is a repository of all the materials the client has sent us. This will tend to have a number of sub-folders.
- *Legal.* Contracts, project proposals, invoices (which should be its own sub-folder), etc.
- *Planning.* All the early-stage discovery & planning materials.
- *Reporting.* Our weekly data & metrics reports that we share with clients.
- *Shareable.* Documents, graphics, etc., that have been approved for public consumption.

*A note on Docs & Files:* Whenever drafting documents that require more formatting than simple rich text (proposals, spreadsheets, etc.), you should _*always*_ use [Google Apps for Work][google-work] and link to the file in Basecamp’s “Docs & Files” tab. Do not use Microsoft Word, etc., if you’re the originator of the document.

## Internal basecamps

Internal basecamps (for our own company use) can have simpler, more descriptive names like `The Office` or `Heartbeats`. We use them as the central hub of our internal work --- our remote office / shared space.

### The Office

*[The Office][office]* is our primary internal basecamp. It’s a bit of a catch-all space for internal company updates, policies, small talk, scheduling, etc. Our office “water cooler,” if you will.

### Heartbeats

Shamelessly borrowed from Basecamp’s Jason Fried, *[Heartbeats][heartbeats]* is a basecamp dedicated to keeping everyone in the loop at Hines Digital. It’s made up of three main parts:

- *Automatic Questions:* Basecamp automatically asks everyone on the team two questions: (1) `What will you be working on this week?` and (2) `What did you work on today?`
- *Heartbeat Requests:* The basecamp has a single to-do list, called `Heartbeat Requests`, where you can add a task and ask for an update from a team member. Curious to know something that hasn’t been shared in a while? Add a to-do and request it! If you know who should write it, just assign it to them and Basecamp will let them know. If you don’t, just add the to-do with no assignment and someone will pick it up.
- *A Message Board:* Someone from each team should post an update to the message board once every few weeks just to update everyone on how things are going. That might be one update per client project, for example. There’s no hard-and-fast rule; just keep folks in the loop.

## Campfires

We don’t expect everyone to be in chat all day long. In fact, we discourage it. It’s hard to do your best work when you’re constantly in a chat room.

Rather than rewrite it, we recommend that you read and internalize this [long-form article][group-chat] by Basecamp’s Jason Fried (he’s a smart guy!) about group chat’s pros and cons.

## Notifications

Not everything is urgent, and work can wait --- especially at night. If it’s really that serious, someone will call you. Take a few minutes and configure your [notification settings][basecamp-notifications] to your satisfaction so you can have some peace of mind.

## The Apps

Basecamp is better when you use it through the apps:

- [Android][apps]
- [Desktop][apps]
- [iOS][apps]
